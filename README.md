# Hackathon Rules

This is a fork of standard competition rules used at MLH Member Hackathons. We have edited the rules a bit. If you have a suggestion for these rules or a question about them, please submit an issue [here](https://github.com/SDHacks/hackathon-rules/issues).

- [Rules](Rules.md): The list of rules participants must follow and the judging criteria.
