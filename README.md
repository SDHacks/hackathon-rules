# Hackathon Rules

This is a fork of standard competition rules used at MLH Member Hackathons. We have edited the rules a bit. If you have a suggestion for these rules or a question about them, please submit an issue [here](https://github.com/SDHacks/hackathon-rules/issues).

There are several documents in the _Hackathon Rules_:

- [Advice to Organizers](Advice to Organizers.md): A few tips for organizers on how to make sure they create a fun and fair competition.
- [Rules](Rules.md): The list of rules participants must follow and the judging criteria.
- [Cheating Response Procedure](Cheating Response Procedure.md): How people can report violations of the rules and how those reports will be dealt with.
